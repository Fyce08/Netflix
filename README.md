# Key Insights
**Titles, Ratings, Genres:** The dataset encompasses a wide variety of Netflix content, categorised into two main types: Movies (4,265 titles) and TV Shows (1,969 titles). The movie-to-TV show ratio indicates a higher concentration of films in the library. 

**Ratings Distribution:** The chart displays the breakdown of content based on ratings, with TV-MA (mature audiences) being the most prevalent rating, followed by TV-14. This suggests that Netflix leans heavily towards content tailored for adult audiences. Ratings like TV-Y7 and G are far less frequent, indicating a smaller portion of children’s content. 

**Genre Popularity:** The top 10 genres include Documentaries, Stand-Up Comedy, and International Movies, among others. This highlights the platform's focus on diverse genres, with a significant portion of content focused on international films and documentaries. 

**Content Distribution by Country:** The world map visualisation shows that Netflix's content comes from a variety of regions, with the United States, India, and the United Kingdom as leading contributors. This illustrates Netflix’s global content acquisition strategy, where it sources from both well-established and emerging film industries. 

**Movies vs. TV Shows:** The pie chart demonstrates that movies make up a majority of the content on Netflix, with 4,265 films compared to 1,969 TV shows. This distribution implies that Netflix continues to prioritize its movie catalog. 

**Content Release Trends:** The timeline reveals a significant increase in the number of titles, particularly between 2015 and 2018. This period marked a substantial rise in Netflix’s content production and acquisition, likely driven by its expansion into international markets and original productions.
